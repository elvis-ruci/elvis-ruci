### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my random page

My name is Elvis Ruci. I am just a random passionate developer whose entire free time is taken by creating random automated scripts and reinventing the wheel by creating random utility apps for personal use from scratch, very !interesting indeed.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating an app to help me with my budgeting by reading the transactions from my bank and using the data to forecast my spending for the current month to help me not lose touch with my spending habits. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mobile development in flutter, thanks to my desire to have some tools readily accessible from my phone at any time.

- ðŸ“« If you need to reach me for any reason you can do so here: elvisruci00@gmail.com

- âš¡ A very random fun fact: Humpback whales don't eat for most of the year. How? Why? I'm not sure.
