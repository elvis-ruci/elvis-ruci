### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my random page

My name is Elvis Ruci. I am just a random passionate developer who's entire free time is taken by creating random automated scripts and reinventing the wheel by creating random utility apps for personal use from scratch, very !interesting indeed.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating an app to help me with my budgeting by reading the transactions from my bank and using the data to forcast my spendings for the current month to help not loose touch with my spending habbits. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mobile development in flutter, thanks to my desire to have some tools readily accesable from my phone at any time.

- ðŸ“« If you need to reach me for any reason you can do so here: elvisruci00@gmail.com

- âš¡ A very random fun fact: Humpback whales dont eat for most of the year. How? Why? I'm not sure.
